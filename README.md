# Design Handoff

In this assignment we worked with the UX class and made one of their designs come to life. I built it in react by using some styled components and npm packages.

## The problem

I approached this task by watching Cecilia, the UX designer, go though the design in Figma. After that I talked to de developers in my group on how to structure the code roughly and after that I made a sketch in Figma with the different components. I started off by creating components of the different part of the page then in each component also used some styled-components.

Me and Ajmal from my team talked and worked alot together to complete this rader advanced design (for our level at this pont). Im proud of what we did in just 4 days.
